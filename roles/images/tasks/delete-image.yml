# Delete an image
# To delete a local copy of an image, enter the following command:
$ incus image delete <image_ID>

# Deleting an image wonâ€™t affect running instances that are already using it, but it will remove the image locally.
# After deletion, if the image was downloaded from a remote server, it will be removed from local cache and downloaded again on next use.
# However, if the image was manually created (not cached), the image will be deleted.
