# Images are located in the image store of your local server or a remote Incus server. You can export them to a file though.
# This method can be useful to back up image files or to transfer them to an air-gapped environment.

# To export a container image to a file, enter the following command:
$ incus image export [<remote>:]<image> [<output_directory_path>]

# To export a virtual machine image to a file, add the --vm flag:
$ incus image export [<remote>:]<image> [<output_directory_path>] --vm

# See Image format for a description of the file structure used for the image.
