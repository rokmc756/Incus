Configure storage bucket settings
See the Storage drivers documentation for the available configuration options for each storage driver that supports object storage.

Use the following command to set configuration options for a storage bucket:

incus storage bucket set <pool_name> <bucket_name> <key> <value>
For example, to set the quota size of a bucket, use the following command:

incus storage bucket set my-pool my-bucket size 1MiB
You can also edit the storage bucket configuration by using the following command:

incus storage bucket edit <pool_name> <bucket_name>
Use the following command to delete a storage bucket and its keys:

incus storage bucket delete <pool_name> <bucket_name>
View storage buckets
You can display a list of all available storage buckets in a storage pool and check their configuration.

To list all available storage buckets in a storage pool, use the following command:

incus storage bucket list <pool_name>
To show detailed information about a specific bucket, use the following command:

incus storage bucket show <pool_name> <bucket_name>
Resize a storage bucket
By default, storage buckets do not have a quota applied.

To set or change a quota for a storage bucket, set its size configuration:

incus storage bucket set <pool_name> <bucket_name> size <new_size>
Important

Growing a storage bucket usually works (if the storage pool has sufficient storage).

You cannot shrink a storage bucket below its current used size.

Manage storage bucket keys
To access a storage bucket, applications must use a set of S3 credentials made up of an access key and a secret key. You can create multiple sets of credentials for a specific bucket.

Each set of credentials is given a key name. The key name is used only for reference and does not need to be provided to the application that uses the credentials.

Each set of credentials has a role that specifies what operations they can perform on the bucket.

The roles available are:

admin - Full access to the bucket

read-only - Read-only access to the bucket (list and get files only)

If the role is not specified when creating a bucket key, the role used is read-only.

Create storage bucket keys
Use the following command to create a set of credentials for a storage bucket:

incus storage bucket key create <pool_name> <bucket_name> <key_name> [configuration_options...]
Use the following command to create a set of credentials for a storage bucket with a specific role:

incus storage bucket key create <pool_name> <bucket_name> <key_name> --role=admin [configuration_options...]
These commands will generate and display a random set of credential keys.

Edit or delete storage bucket keys
Use the following command to edit an existing bucket key:

incus storage bucket key edit <pool_name> <bucket_name> <key_name>
Use the following command to delete an existing bucket key:

incus storage bucket key delete <pool_name> <bucket_name> <key_name>
View storage bucket keys
Use the following command to see the keys defined for an existing bucket:

incus storage bucket key list <pool_name> <bucket_name>
Use the following command to see a specific bucket key:

incus storage bucket key show <pool_name> <bucket_name> <key_name>
