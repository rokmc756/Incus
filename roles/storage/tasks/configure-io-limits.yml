# Configure I/O limits
# When you attach a storage volume to an instance as a disk device, you can configure I/O limits for it. To do so, set the limits.read,
# limits.write or limits.max properties to the corresponding limits. See the Type: disk reference for more information.
#
# The limits are applied through the Linux blkio cgroup controller, which makes it possible to restrict I/O at the disk level (but nothing finer grained than that).
#
# [ Note ]
# Because the limits apply to a whole physical disk rather than a partition or path, the following restrictions apply:
# Limits will not apply to file systems that are backed by virtual devices (for example, device mapper).
# If a file system is backed by multiple block devices, each device will get the same limit.
#  If two disk devices that are backed by the same disk are attached to the same instance, the limits of the two devices will be averaged.
#
# All I/O limits only apply to actual block device access. Therefore, consider the file systemâ€™s own overhead when setting limits.
# Access to cached data is not affected by the limit.
