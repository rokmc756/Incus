# How to create an instance in a specific storage pool
# Instance storage volumes are created in the storage pool that is specified by the instanceâ€™s root disk device. This configuration is normally provided by the profile or profiles applied to the instance. See Default storage pool for detailed information.
# To use a different storage pool when creating or launching an instance, add the --storage flag. This flag overrides the root disk device from the profile. For example:
# $ incus launch <image> <instance_name> --storage <storage_pool>

# Move instance storage volumes to another pool
# To move an instance storage volume to another storage pool, make sure the instance is stopped. Then use the following command to move the instance to a different pool:
# $ incus move <instance_name> --storage <target_pool_name>
