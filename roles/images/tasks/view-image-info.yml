# View image information
# To view information about an image, enter the following command:
$ incus image info <image_ID>

# As the image ID, you can specify either the imageâ€™s alias or its fingerprint. For a remote image, remember to include the remote server (for example, images:ubuntu/22.04).

# To display only the image properties, enter the following command:
$ incus image show <image_ID>

# You can also display a specific image property (located under the properties key) with the following command:
$ incus image get-property <image_ID> <key>

# For example, to show the release name of the official Ubuntu 22.04 image, enter the following command:
$ incus image get-property images:ubuntu/22.04 release
