# Use the default network bridge that you set up during the Incus initialization. Check the default profile to see the default configuration
# incus profile show default


# Use an existing network interface by adding it as a network device to your instance. This network interface is outside of Incus control.
# Therefore, you must specify all information that Incus needs to use the network interface.
#
# shell: incus config device add <instance_name> <device_name> nic nictype=<nic_type> ...


# See Type: nic for a list of available NIC types and their configuration properties.
# For example, you could add a pre-existing Linux bridge (br0) with the following command:
#
# shell: incus config device add <instance_name> eth0 nic nictype=bridged parent=br0


# Create a managed network and add it as a network device to your instance.
# With this method, Incus has all required information about the configured network, and you can directly attach it to your instance as a device:
# shell: incus network attach <network_name> <instance_name> <device_name>
